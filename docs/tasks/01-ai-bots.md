# Task 01: AI Bots Implementation

## Overview

Implement AI-controlled bots for Tactics Clash 2D, taking inspiration from competitive multiplayer shooter gameplay mechanics. These bots will provide challenging opponents for players and fill empty slots in multiplayer matches.

## Inspiration from Competitive Multiplayer Shooters

The AI bot system draws heavily from modern competitive multiplayer shooter bot behavior and gameplay patterns:

### Core Bot Personalities
- **Aggressive**: Rush tactics, prefer close-quarters combat
- **Defensive**: Hold positions, cover teammates
- **Tactical**: Use cover effectively, coordinate with team
- **Sniper**: Prefer long-range engagements, positioning-focused

### Movement Patterns
- **Pathfinding**: Navigate complex 2D maps with destructible terrain
- **Cover Usage**: Seek and utilize cover points effectively  
- **Team Formation**: Maintain tactical spacing with other bots/players
- **Map Control**: Contest key areas and choke points

## Technical Requirements

### Bot AI System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Decision Making System
- **State Machine**: Idle, Patrol, Engage, Retreat, Objective
- **Threat Assessment**: Evaluate nearby enemies and prioritize targets
- **Objective Awareness**: Understand map objectives and team goals
- **Risk/Reward Calculations**: Evaluate engagement opportunities

#### 2. Movement & Navigation
- **A* Pathfinding**: Navigate around obstacles and destructible terrain
- **Dynamic Path Updates**: Adapt to environment changes during gameplay
- **Movement Prediction**: Anticipate player movements for interception
- **Strafe Patterns**: Competitive shooter inspired movement during combat

#### 3. Combat Behavior
- **Weapon Selection**: Choose appropriate weapons for different situations
- **Aiming System**: Realistic aiming with configurable accuracy
- **Recoil Compensation**: Handle weapon recoil patterns
- **Grenade Usage**: Strategic use of throwables (if implemented)

#### 4. Team Coordination
- **Communication System**: Share enemy positions and tactical information
- **Formation Tactics**: Coordinate pushes and defensive positions
- **Crossfire Setup**: Position for overlapping fields of fire
- **Covering Fire**: Support teammates during movements

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Bot Framework
- [ ] Bot entity creation and management
- [ ] Basic movement and pathfinding
- [ ] Simple state machine (Idle, Patrol, Engage)
- [ ] Integration with existing multiplayer system

### Phase 2: Combat System
- [ ] Target acquisition and tracking
- [ ] Weapon handling and firing mechanics
- [ ] Basic aiming system with accuracy scaling
- [ ] Health management and respawn logic

### Phase 3: Advanced AI Behavior
- [ ] Personality system implementation
- [ ] Advanced decision making
- [ ] Cover usage and tactical positioning
- [ ] Dynamic difficulty adjustment

### Phase 4: Team Coordination
- [ ] Bot-to-bot communication
- [ ] Team strategy implementation
- [ ] Objective-based behavior
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Configuration Options

### Difficulty Levels
- **Novice**: Slow reaction times, poor accuracy, predictable patterns
- **Intermediate**: Moderate skills, occasional tactical mistakes
- **Expert**: Quick reactions, high accuracy, good tactics
- **Elite**: Near-human level performance, advanced coordination

### Customizable Parameters
```javascript
const botConfig = {
  reactionTime: 0.2,        // seconds
  accuracy: 0.75,           // 0.0 to 1.0
  aggression: 0.6,          // 0.0 to 1.0
  teamwork: 0.8,           // 0.0 to 1.0
  adaptability: 0.7,        // 0.0 to 1.0
  preferredWeapons: ['rifle', 'sniper'],
  personality: 'tactical'
};
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### WebRTC Multiplayer
- Bots run on the host client to maintain network consistency
- Bot actions are synchronized across all connected clients
- Seamless integration with existing player management

### Game Engine Integration
- Utilize existing physics system for movement and projectiles
- Integrate with collision detection for pathfinding
- Use existing weapon and damage systems

### UI Integration
- Bot status indicators in team roster
- Bot difficulty controls in game settings
- Real-time bot performance metrics (optional debug mode)

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- **Update Frequency**: Reduce AI update rates for distant or inactive bots
- **LOD System**: Simplify AI behavior when bots are off-screen
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar AI calculations for efficiency
- **Memory Management**: Efficient data structures for pathfinding and decision trees

### Resource Limits
- Maximum concurrent bots: 8 (4 per team)
- AI update frequency: 10Hz (every 100ms)
- Pathfinding cache: 30-second TTL for computed paths

## Testing Strategy

### AI Behavior Testing
- Unit tests for decision-making logic
- Integration tests with game systems
- Performance benchmarks under various loads
- Multiplayer stability testing with mixed human/bot matches

### Balance Testing
- Bot vs human win rates across difficulty levels
- Weapon usage statistics and effectiveness
- Map-specific performance analysis
- Team coordination effectiveness metrics

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Bots can effectively navigate all existing maps
- [ ] Win rate against human players matches intended difficulty
- [ ] No performance degradation with maximum bot count
- [ ] Seamless integration with multiplayer matches
- [ ] Positive player feedback on bot behavior realism

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- **Machine Learning**: Train bots on player behavior data
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Real-time adjustment based on player performance
- **Custom Bot Training**: Allow players to teach bots custom strategies
- **Tournament Mode**: Specialized bots for competitive play

### Community Features
- **Bot Sharing**: Export/import bot configurations
- **Bot Tournaments**: AI vs AI competitions
- **Behavior Analytics**: Detailed statistics on bot performance
- **Custom Personalities**: Community-created bot personalities
